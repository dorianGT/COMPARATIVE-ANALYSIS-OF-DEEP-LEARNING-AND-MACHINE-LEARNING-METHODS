# COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS-OF-DEEP-LEARNING-AND-MACHINE-LEARNING-METHODS
We compare classical machine learning classification  methods with more recent deep learning methods. Our goal is to provide insights into the performance,  scalability, and interpretability of these methods, thus guiding practitioners in choosing the most suitable  approach for sentiment classification tasks.
